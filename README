A simple visual CPU performance indicator, designed to look like the
original (but apparently never released) Sun Solaris perfbar, but
using GTK for display.

Color scheme:
  Blue:   Idle
  Green:  User
  Red:    System (kernel)
  Yellow: Other (nice, iowait)

If the prebuilt versions don't work for you, type one of
  make solaris_sparc_perfbar
  make solaris_x86_perfbar
  make linux_perfbar
or edit the make file and add a target.

You can rename the binaries to just "perfbar". I do.

To port it to other machines, you'd have to figure out how to
implement "get_times". It would be nice to use libgtop for this, but
libgtop didn't work right on machines I tried to run this on.
